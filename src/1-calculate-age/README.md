# Calculate Age

## Problem
Calculating the age of a person can be harder than you think.  You can't just subtract the years of two dates from eachother.  We need you to write a function that accepts two arguments - a birth date and a death date - and outputs the age of the person by are the time of the death date.

## Where to Begin
Start by researching age algorithms.  There are a few different approaches.  Edit `calculate-age.js` and write the solution in the `ageAtDeath` function.

You can test your code at any time by running `npm run test age` from terminal within this directory.

Be prepared to explain why you took the approach you did.

## Requirements
* You may not install any additional dependencies
* Function must accept two arguments and output the age of the person
* You may not alter the tests already in the test file.  Feel free to add additional tests.
* `npm run test age` must pass

# Calculate Age

## Problem
Calculating the age of a person can be harder than you think.  You can't just subtract the years of two dates from eachother.  We need you to write a function that accepts two arguments - a birth date and an end date - and outputs the age of the person by the time of the end date.

## Where to Begin
Start by researching age algorithms.  There are a few different approaches.  Edit `current-age.js` and write the solution in the `age` function.

You can test your code at any time by running `npm run test age` from terminal within this directory.

Be prepared to explain why you took the approach you did.

## Requirements
* Function must accept two arguments and output the age of the person
* You may not alter the test file
* `npm run test age` must pass

# Anagram

## Problem
For some reason we have become obsessed with anagrams.  We are not sure why, but due to the recent influx of anagrams, we are outsourcing checking the validity of them to a machine.

You must write a function that compares two strings and determine whether or not they are an anagram.

## Where to Begin
Start by researching anagrams and some potential algorithms for detecting an anagram.  Edit `anagram.js` and write the solution in the `anagram` function.

You can test your code at any time by running `npm run test anagram` from terminal within this directory.

Be prepared to explain why you took the approach you did.

## Requirements
* Function must accept two arguments and determine if they are anagrams of eachother
* Function must return true if an anagram is present
* Function must reutnr false if an anagram is not present
* You may not alter the test file
* `npm run test anagram` must pass
